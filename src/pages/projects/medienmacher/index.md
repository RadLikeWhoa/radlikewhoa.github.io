teaser: "A complete rebranding of the company required a new visual identity along with a new corporate website. The new site shows the company on a more human level and focuses on select key showcases."

In 2018, what used to be «Schwabe AG» was rebranded entirely to «Die Medienmacher AG». This process brought many changes with it, especially a completely new visual identity that was to be reflected on the company website.

# What I've learned

Starting this project from scratch meant I had a lot of opportunities to structure a Neos site in a manner that follows best practices better, seeing as I'd now had an advanced level of experience with the CMS. This way, planning the content elements and integrations ahead of development lead to a more readable and maintainable code base.

# Technologies I've used

The site runs on Neos CMS. Creating the content elements was the most challenging part of this project, seeing as some of the sections involved more advanced Fusion code.
