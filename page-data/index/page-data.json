This is quite common with things like accordions, where clicking on a heading toggles the following section open and closes all other sections. There you expect the opening section to start with a height of 0, and then expand to its full height. This state transformation is usually handled with a quick transition of the <code class=\"language-text\">height</code> property, in order to make the change less jarring to the user.</p>\n<p>This all works fine when all sections have the same height. Then you can directly transition from <code class=\"language-text\">height: 0;</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">height: xy;</code>.

In our team, we quickly came up with an idea for a jump'n'run game, but due to time constraints and the team being reduced to two people, the original idea ended up being too ambitious and unrealistic for the given time frame. During a workshop conducted as part of the lecture, we were brainstorming some ideas and I decided to combine some of the ideas for our own project.</p>\n<p>Aesthetically, the game uses the familiar 8-bit style with purely black and white graphics, very much resembling a classic iteration of Pong. On top of that, we have our own mechanics. In a round of the game, the first players selects a target. They decide if they shoot for the top or the bottom half of the field. Then they select a claim which the opponent will see. This is where players have the chance to bluff as they can state a claim that is different from their actual target. It is then up to the other player to defend one half of the field. At this point, a little bit of communication helps a lot as it gives the defender an opportunity to get an idea of the opponent's strategy.</p>\n<p>Unlike the classic arcade game, PONG?! can be a rather slow game. Players are encouraged to seek communication with their rivals in order to have a better chance at discovering the bluff. This creates interesting situations which can vary greatly if you are playing against someone you know very well or against someone you've only just met.</p>\n<h1 id=\"things-ive-learned\"><a href=\"#things-ive-learned\" aria-label=\"things ive learned permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Things I've learned</h1>\n<p>This project was mainly an exercise in idea finding.

Stack would have been the much better alternative for dependency management, however, getting a somewhat current version of Haskell to run on the Raspberry Pi was hard enough already, so setting one up that was also compatible with Stack was something we did not want to tackle.</p>\n<p>We decided to use Haskell only for the backend and the hardware communication.

These six emotions — amused, sad, excited, scared, inspired, weird — were to be the core of the experience. A user visits the site and is presented with these emotions. They then select one option and can view a list of movies that match this emotion. This list can then be sorted by various criteria, such as release date, percentage of match or when they were added to the database.</p>\n<figure>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1100px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 73.17767653758543%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"search\" title=\"search\" src=\"/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/566ce/search.png\" srcset=\"/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/90c99/search.png 275w,\n/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/2cf63/search.png 550w,\n/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/566ce/search.png 1100w,\n/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/574ac/search.png 1650w,\n/static/ba2deecec05efa4958d9e772d48b31c8/1ebe0/search.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <figcaption data-marginalia=\"right\">Search functionality using <abbr title=\"The Movie Database\">TMDB</abbr> data.

We separated the team into two groups, one of them working on the front end while the other one was working on the back end parts of the system.</p>\n<p>Aside from the difficulties in working with Angular we had some initial struggles with understanding all the terminologies that are used in a regular scouts organisation.

As the name suggests, it stems from JSON (\"JavaScript Object Notation\"), but with a wrapper around it (called \"padding\").</p>\n<p>Now, you might be wondering what's wrong with using plain JSON. Most browsers follow the so-called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\" title=\"Same-origin policy on MDN\">same-origin policy</a> which prevents websites from accessing files from other domains unless that permission is explicitly granted through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\" title=\"CORS on Wikipedia\">CORS</a>. The only part of a website that isn't subject to this is the script tag.</p>\n<p>Knowing that we can use this trick to get around the same origin policy we can embed a script file served from a different domain containing something a little like the following.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>http://example.com/people/1234?callback=awesome<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token script\"></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token function\">awesome</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Id\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">1234</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Name\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Foo\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Job\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Bar\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>What exactly have we done here?

But in the src-attribute we specify a callback parameter—<code class=\"language-text\">callback=</code>, sometimes also <code class=\"language-text\">jsonp=</code>—which you'll notice again in the actual response. This is the \"P\" in JSONP, the padding. Ideally, the callback you specify should exist before requesting the external resource.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, a JSONP script calls a function with the data you've requested as the only argument.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-i-want-an-easy-to-use-function\"><a href=\"#but-i-want-an-easy-to-use-function\" aria-label=\"but i want an easy to use function permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>But I want an easy-to-use function!</h3>\n<p>It can be very much cumbersome to always go through the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define a callback function that will receive the data later on.</li>\n<li>Add the script tag to request the data.</li>\n<li>Clean up?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's why libraries like jQuery have <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/\" title=\"jQuery&#x27;s getJSON function\">made it easy</a> to request JSONP data.

We need a unique identifier to name our callback so we don't clash with any other callbacks. We use the <code class=\"language-text\">_callbacks</code> variable to store a simple number which we'll increment with every function call.</p>\n<p>In the actual <code class=\"language-text\">jsonp</code> function we set up our variables first.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> id <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'jsonp_cb_'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> _callbacks<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    existing <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementsByTagName</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'script'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    script <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'script'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">id</code> holds the string \"jsonp<em>cb</em>\" joined with our previously defined number because, as you might know, variables in JavaScript must not start with a number.

The next two variables are references to the first script on the page (<code class=\"language-text\">existing</code>) which we'll use insert our new script (<code class=\"language-text\">script</code>).</p>\n<p>After setting all our variables we'll have to build up the scripts source and actually insert it into the page.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">script<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>src <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> url <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">~</span>url<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">indexOf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'?'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">?</span> <span class=\"token string\">'&amp;'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'?'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">'callback='</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> id\nexisting<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>parentNode<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">insertBefore</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>script<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> existing<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When setting the src-attribute we check if it contains a question mark already. If it does we'll have to add the callback parameter preceded by an ampersand, otherwise preceded by a question mark. This is simply how query strings are handled. The callback parameter is set to a function with the unique name we have stored in our ID. You'll see this function in a second.</p>\n<p>Inserting a DOM node isn't the prettiest thing in JavaScript, but it's easy. We'll insert the newly created script right before the first existing script. To do that, we'll have to access the existing script's parent—usually the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;head&gt;</code> or the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;body&gt;</code>—and call the <code class=\"language-text\">insertBefore</code> method on it. This method receives the new DOM node to be insterted and the node it should be insterted before.</p>\n<p>At this point we'll have to attach the callback function to the window.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">window<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">data</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  script<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>parentNode<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">removeChild</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>script<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">callback</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">delete</span> window<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You might be suprised that this is not the function you actually define when calling <code class=\"language-text\">jsonp</code>. This is because this function also handles the cleaning up for you. First it removes the requested script from the page, then it calls your callback from the function call and at the end it will remove itself from the window. That means that there are no unnecessary traces left from your request and you can handle the data however you want.</p>\n<p>(Note: Deleting a property on the window might cause errors in older browsers.

Some pretty major downsides, even. First off, there is no proper error handling. As there are no status codes and no response codes sent, you'll have to hope for the best to happen. And there is more than one place where things can go wrong.</p>\n<p>The url you requested can be outdated or simply contain a typo. The <code class=\"language-text\">jsonp</code> function has no way to know about this as it just insterts a script onto the page. But even if the request is successful you'll have to check if the data returned is correct and there is no standardised way to do this. Some APIs offer error messages, some don't. And usually, no two API providers structure their content the same way.</p>\n<p>As with every other technology, security concerns are raised, but with JSONP, the concerns have a valid point. A script requested through JSONP can hold any JavaScript. There is no globally accepted specification that forces a specific format. That means your requested file can happily execute whatever it wants to and you probably won't even notice it. There are <a href=\"http://json-p.org\" title=\"Proposal for safer JSONP\">proposals for a safer solution</a>, but they have yet to be enforced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>There's not too much of a conclusion to draw here. Use JSONP if you want to use an API that doesn't support CORS. Don't use JSONP if you're too concerned about security issues or want proper error handling.</p>\n<p>Note that, while this function is rather robust and works in most situations, some APIs don't use <code class=\"language-text\">callback</code> for the parameter name.

That's why many blogs use syntax highlighting on their code blocks to help their readers better understand the displayed code.</p>\n<p>Jekyll was created with this in mind so it offers easy integration with tools like <a href=\"http://pygments.org\" title=\"Pygments&#x27; project page\">Pygments</a> to automatically highlight all code blocks in your posts. However, Pygments is written in Python, while Jekyll is written in Ruby. Because of this a <a href=\"https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb\" title=\"Pygments.rb on GitHub\">Ruby wrapper</a> for the Python tool is needed, slowing builds down significantly.</p>\n<p>Because of this, developers have come up with alternatives. One of those is called <a href=\"https://github.com/jneen/rouge\" title=\"Rouge on GitHub\">Rouge</a> and in this post I will show you how you can (and why you should) integrate Rouge into your Jekyll setup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefits-of-using-rouge\"><a href=\"#benefits-of-using-rouge\" aria-label=\"benefits of using rouge permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Benefits of using Rouge</h3>\n<p>First of all, it's a lot cleaner to use a Ruby-based syntax highlighter in a Ruby-based setup. You eliminate the need to spawn Python processes right away, which reduces your build time considerably.</p>\n<p>At this point you might think of <a href=\"http://coderay.rubychan.de\" title=\"CodeRay&#x27;s project page\">CodeRay</a>, another Ruby-based syntax highlighter. You could also use that, but Rouge comes with support for all Pygments themes, making it easier to discover new styles for your code blocks. Also, Rouge is just a little bit faster.</p>\n<p>On my admittedly small site, a standard <code class=\"language-text\">jekyll build</code> command took about 28 seconds to complete. Using CodeRay, the build time reduced to 18 seconds, while using Rouge cut the build time by another 2 seconds down to 16 seconds. A total saving of about <strong>40%</strong> is amazing, especially when you want to preview your posts regularly while you're writing them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installing-rouge\"><a href=\"#installing-rouge\" aria-label=\"installing rouge permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Installing Rouge</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to use Rouge is using the <a href=\"http://kramdown.gettalong.org\" title=\"kramdown&#x27;s project page\">kramdown</a> markdown parser. They recently added native support for Rouge and Jekyll has been supporting kramdown for a while now.</p>\n<p>First, make sure you're using a recent version of Jekyll (for example <strong>2.5.0</strong>). You can check your installed version using <code class=\"language-text\">jekyll -v</code>. Next up, you need to install kramdown and Rouge.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">gem <span class=\"token function\">install</span> kramdown rouge</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you already have a version of kramdown on your machine, make sure it's at least on version <strong>1.5.0</strong>. If you've followed these steps so far you're now ready to use kramdown and Rouge within your Jekyll setup.</p>\n<p>By the way, if, like me, you're always getting errors doing anything with Rouge, remember <em>it's called Rouge, not Rogue</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-rouge-with-jekyll\"><a href=\"#using-rouge-with-jekyll\" aria-label=\"using rouge with jekyll permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using Rouge with Jekyll</h3>\n<p>As with all options concerning your builds, the place to add them is in your <code class=\"language-text\">_config.yml</code>. You might have an entry like <code class=\"language-text\">highlighter: pygments</code> in there, make sure to remove that. In my site's configuration I'm using the following options:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">markdown</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> kramdown\n\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">kramdown</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">input</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> GFM\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">syntax_highlighter</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> rouge</code></pre></div>\n<p>This tells Jekyll to use kramdown when parsing markdown files and to pass the two settings to kramdown whenever it's run. <code class=\"language-text\">input: GFM</code> allows me to use the same syntax for markdown files I'd use on GitHub, which is especially useful for code blocks. You can now write code blocks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">`​`` html\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>a href<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\"#\"<span class=\"token operator\">></span>Hello world<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>a<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n`​``</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note the <code class=\"language-text\">html</code> after the first pair of triple backticks (`). This tells Rouge what language to use for the code block. You can view all supported languages with samples on <a href=\"http://rouge.jayferd.us/demo\" title=\"Rouge language demos\">Rouge's demo site</a>.</p>\n<p>Rouge adds classes to your code blocks, allowing you to style parts of your code from a stylesheet. Rouge has the added benefit of being compatible with stylesheets created for Pygments (of which there are <em><a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=pygments+style\" title=\"Find new Pygments themes\">lots</a></em>).</p>\n<p>The only drawback for now is that kramdown only lets you define the standard language to use for your code blocks, all other options are not yet supported. This also means that line numbers are not yet supported. If you absolutely want that feature, you'll have to wait for a little while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-rouge-in-jekyll-3-on-github-pages\"><a href=\"#using-rouge-in-jekyll-3-on-github-pages\" aria-label=\"using rouge in jekyll 3 on github pages permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using Rouge in Jekyll 3 on GitHub Pages</h3>\n<p>Ever since GitHub pages have upgraded Jekyll to version 3 you can use Rouge as your default syntax highlighter.

Consider, for example, a button with some different styles, written using the BEM (\"Base, Element, Modifier\") style.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>button button--primary button--wide<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Button<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.button</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token selector\">.button--primary</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token selector\">.button--wide</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The problem is instantly visible. We end up with three classes. One for the basic button (<code class=\"language-text\">button</code>) and two for its modifiers (<code class=\"language-text\">button--primary button--wide</code>). Using a preprocessor you could extend the base class from within the modifiers, but this is also not a very elegant solution. To solve this exact problem, Glen Maddern and Ben Schwarz came up with <a href=\"http://amcss.github.io\" title=\"Attribute Module CSS\">AMCSS</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attribute-modules\"><a href=\"#attribute-modules\" aria-label=\"attribute modules permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Attribute Modules</h3>\n<p>The idea is to use custom attributes on your HTML elements, instead of using classes. On their website, they provide the following example.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Large primary button --></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>btn btn-primary btn-lg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Large primary button<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- becomes --></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">am-Button</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>primary large<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Large primary button<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This way, you don't have to use a base class as the attribute itself acts as the base. It's also more readable and, in my opinion, easier to write. In your CSS you would use attribute selectors, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">[data-button]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token selector\">[data-button~=\"primary\"]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token selector\">[data-button~=\"large\"]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This example uses the tilde-attribute selector. This matches a keyword in a space-separated list. You could also use other attribute selectors, but this way you have a strict format to follow, preventing you from making mistakes.</p>\n<p>As you can see, AMCSS doesn't let you write any less CSS. Instead, the CSS is more efficient and you can see clear benefits in your HTML.</p>\n<p>I follow this style most of the time. However, I'm using standard <code class=\"language-text\">data-*</code> attributes, instead of custom attributes like <code class=\"language-text\">am-button</code>. This allows me to add and remove modifiers through JavaScript more easily.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">link<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>dataset<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>button <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'primary large'</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"an-example-grid-columns\"><a href=\"#an-example-grid-columns\" aria-label=\"an example grid columns permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>An example: grid columns</h3>\n<p>To give you an example of how I use this style I'd like to show you my grid columns. The grid itself is a <code class=\"language-text\">data-grid</code> component, while the columns are <code class=\"language-text\">data-col</code> components. Just including those attributes in an HTML tag is enough, they don't need to have a value.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">data-grid</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">data-col</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>1-2 M1-4 L1-5<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">data-col</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>1-2 M1-4 L1-5<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- ... --></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see I'm using a standard grid component (possible modifiers would be <code class=\"language-text\">gutterless</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">rev</code>) wrapping some column components.

You can <code class=\"language-text\">{% assign %}</code> a variable and you can <code class=\"language-text\">{% capture %}</code> a variable. The difference might not be obvious, but it's simple once you get it.</p>\n<p>Assigning a value to a variable means that you take any kind of data (e.g. a string, a number, a boolean) and Liquid knows that you want to access that exact data when you refer to this variable. An assigned variable is fixed, that means you can not use the value returned from other Liquid tags.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">assign</span> awesome <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> true <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> awesome <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>p<span class=\"token operator\">></span>Yay, awesome<span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>p<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endif</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}</code></pre></div>\n<p>But what if you want to store a Liquid tags's return value in a variable? That's exactly what the <code class=\"language-text\">{% capture %}</code> block is for. Unlike assigned variables, captured variables can only hold strings — which will cause us some trouble later on. This is simply because Liquid tags return strings by default.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">capture</span> value <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  {{ page.title <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">upcase</span> }} from {{ page.date <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">date</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> \"<span class=\"token operator\">%</span>b <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>d, <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>y\" }}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endcapture</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see in the above example, you can capture any number of strings into a variable, be it strings returned from a Liquid tag or fixed strings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-the-word-count-conditional\"><a href=\"#making-the-word-count-conditional\" aria-label=\"making the word count conditional permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Making the word count conditional</h3>\n<p>Now that you know about <code class=\"language-text\">{% assign %}</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">{% capture %}</code> we can move on to store our word count in a variable. The question remains, do we assign the variable or do we capture it?</p>\n<p>It should be clear by now that we'll have to capture the value as it's returned from a Liquid tag. That gives us something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">capture</span> words <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  {{ page.content <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> number_of_words }}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endcapture</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's say we considered posts that are shorter than 250 words not worthy of getting the word count. A good example for this would be 'link list'-style post that consist of mostly a quote from the original article and a comment spanning a sentence or two. Ideally, this would be taken care of using a simple conditional block.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> words <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">250</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  {{ words }}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endif</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}</code></pre></div>\n<p>But you'll soon see that this won't work as intended as Jekyll will throw you this error an error saying you've attempted to compare a string (the words) with a number (250), which is entirely true, and also, sadly, entirely not possible. There is, however, a simple workaround.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"liquid\"><pre class=\"language-liquid\"><code class=\"language-liquid\">{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">capture</span> words <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  {{ page.content <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> number_of_words <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">minus</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">250</span> }}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endcapture</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">unless</span> words contains \"<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>\" <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}\n  {{ words <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">plus</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">250</span> }}\n{<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">endunless</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span>}</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can use Liquid filters to substract your minimum number from the word count to see if it falls below 0. If it does it will contain a '-' at the beginning, which means the post is too short and won't get the word number displayed. If our variable doesn't contain a '-' we can simply add our minimum number back to the word count and display it. Quite simple, right?</p>\n<h3 id=\"customising-the-output\"><a href=\"#customising-the-output\" aria-label=\"customising the output permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Customising the output</h3>\n<p>Now that we finally have our word number along with the conditional to hide it from short posts we can move on to make the output a bit nicer.

Luckily, the open source community was <a href=\"https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa/Countable/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">very interested</a> in Countable so there were lots of people willing to help improve the library.</p>\n<p>This was more or less the first time I worked on a repository with multiple contributors so I had to learn how to manage issues, pull requests and how to communicate with people efficiently.</p>\n<p>It was also very interesting to take testing more seriously than I have before. I've tried to include tests for all use cases and I'm monitoring tests using <a href=\"http://travis-ci.org\">TravisCI</a>. While the setup was a little tedious at first I can now clearly see the benefits of automating tests in order to achieve better quality and to catch errors.</p>\n<p>To make it easier for people to install and use Countable I chose to make them available through <a href=\"http://bower.io\">bower</a> and <a href=\"https://npmjs.com\">npm</a>. This means I had to respect the semantic versioning conventions, which seem rather simple even though it's actually quite hard to know when a new version is needed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technologies-ive-used\"><a href=\"#technologies-ive-used\" aria-label=\"technologies ive used permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies I've used</h1>\n<p>The library itself is just plain JavaScript.

SSGS' moderate success got me interested in using GitHub more seriously and to start contributing to other open-source projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technologies-ive-used\"><a href=\"#technologies-ive-used\" aria-label=\"technologies ive used permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies I've used</h1>\n<p>It's a relatively simple project. The biggest part of it is the SCSS code. Version 1 didn't rely on many features of SCSS and could've been implemented in basic CSS as well.</p>\n<p>However, version 2 took things a step further. I started using loops, conditionals, extends, etc. and while the codebase turned more and more complex, SSGS became more and more powerful. In fact, I'm using a slightly modified version of SSGS on this site.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"01.04.2011","title":"SSGS","end":null,"pattern":"dots","background":"rgb(207, 118, 89)","tags":["Web","Library","Sass"],"path":"/projects/ssgs","teaser":"Grid systems are a fundamental part of design.
