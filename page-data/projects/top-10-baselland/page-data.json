Each entry is displayed with vibrant imagery, a short description and all the required information. All of this was to be made available through a website, as well as through apps on iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>While designing the UI, I quickly realised that images needed to be the focus of the experience. This made browsing the list of entries more enjoyable and allows users to quickly get an overview of each category. On the detail pages, users could then get a deeper preview of the experience through hero images and galleries.</p>\n<h1 id=\"things-ive-learned\"><a href=\"#things-ive-learned\" aria-label=\"things ive learned permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Things I've learned</h1>\n<p>I designed both the website and the application UI.

Since I'd gathered some experience with the technology in other projects, getting the site up and running was fairly easy. Data about categories and entries was to be made available from the website through a REST API, which took some time to figure out, but worked seamlessly in the end.</p>\n<p>Working with Angular inside the Ionic app was challenging as I was so used to React. What was most impressive for me was seeing how TypeScript could be of value and how I could implement it in other projects as well.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"24 November 2017","path":"/projects/top-10-baselland","title":"Top 10 Baselland","end":null,"client":"Baselland Tourismus","link":"https://top10-baselland.ch","repo":null,"team":3,"pattern":"cubes","background":"rgb(201, 44, 68)","teaser":"In an effort to showcase the most beautiful sights and experiences the canton of Basel-Country has to offer, the local office of tourism decided to create a brand new website and an accompanying app.","tags":["Web","Mobile","Site","App"],"technologies":["Neos CMS","PHP","Fusion","Fluid","Sass","Ionic","Angular"],"tasks":["Design","Development"],"hero":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"aspectRatio":1.8,"src":"/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/95331/hero.png","srcSet":"/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/51ac9/hero.png 275w,\n/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/7cff2/hero.png 550w,\n/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/95331/hero.png 1100w,\n/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/0ec6e/hero.png 1650w,\n/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/15f2e/hero.png 2200w,\n/static/c36bcd1a3d0c354a35d691b3d1804ed8/7347c/hero.png 2880w","sizes":"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
