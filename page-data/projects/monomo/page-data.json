This meant that there was some uncertainty as to how we should progress inside our team of eight. Much of this came from us working with Moodle, a platform we were struggling to understand. After progress slowed down more and more we decided to approach our client with an alternative: a custom solution, developed completely from scratch.</p>\n<p>We knew about the required functionality from the beginning of the year, we had prototypes designed to show how the interaction would work, both of which allowed us to get started with our new approach very quickly. Going for a Laravel-like setup helped a lot with initial complications so making up the time we lost working with Moodle was easily done.</p>\n<figure>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1100px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 59.62414578587699%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"planning\" title=\"planning\" src=\"/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/566ce/planning.png\" srcset=\"/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/90c99/planning.png 275w,\n/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/2cf63/planning.png 550w,\n/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/566ce/planning.png 1100w,\n/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/574ac/planning.png 1650w,\n/static/cf4b294c4b9f96ea5605abddf262af24/1ebe0/planning.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <figcaption data-marginalia=\"right\">A general planning exercise that teaches students how to schedule work packages most efficiently and distribute the workload.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Learning Management System\">LMS</abbr> was to be used for teaching students at the FHNW about a set of project management tasks by offering them a combination of educational texts, practical examples and exercises.

This was partially due to lack of experience in the field, but it turned out to not be a problem, combining parts of the various frameworks. Still, our solution ended up closely resembling a Laravel setup.</p>\n<figure>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1100px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 42.255125284738035%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"mctest\" title=\"mctest\" src=\"/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/566ce/mctest.png\" srcset=\"/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/90c99/mctest.png 275w,\n/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/2cf63/mctest.png 550w,\n/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/566ce/mctest.png 1100w,\n/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/574ac/mctest.png 1650w,\n/static/d8343f42bf057e236bd8afd5d4a95da4/1ebe0/mctest.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <figcaption data-marginalia=\"right\">Administrators have an easy to use interface for creating and managing exercises.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It was important for us to have a well-documented solution that could be used as the base for a succeeding student project in a later year. This is why we spent a lot of time writing comments and general documentation for all the project disciplines. I learned a lot about automating documentation generation and how to write useful comments in code.</p>\n<p>In the second half of the project I was responsible for Usability Testing. This meant I had to do testing with various participants, sometimes even in the Usability Lab at the FHNW, which offers eye tracking and other useful tools for the field. This experience showed me the importance of thinking about usability early on and how to assess the usability of an application.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technologies-ive-used\"><a href=\"#technologies-ive-used\" aria-label=\"technologies ive used permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies I've used</h1>\n<p>The project was rather simple on the technological level.
