In our team, we quickly came up with an idea for a jump'n'run game, but due to time constraints and the team being reduced to two people, the original idea ended up being too ambitious and unrealistic for the given time frame. During a workshop conducted as part of the lecture, we were brainstorming some ideas and I decided to combine some of the ideas for our own project.</p>\n<p>Aesthetically, the game uses the familiar 8-bit style with purely black and white graphics, very much resembling a classic iteration of Pong. On top of that, we have our own mechanics. In a round of the game, the first players selects a target. They decide if they shoot for the top or the bottom half of the field. Then they select a claim which the opponent will see. This is where players have the chance to bluff as they can state a claim that is different from their actual target. It is then up to the other player to defend one half of the field. At this point, a little bit of communication helps a lot as it gives the defender an opportunity to get an idea of the opponent's strategy.</p>\n<p>Unlike the classic arcade game, PONG?! can be a rather slow game. Players are encouraged to seek communication with their rivals in order to have a better chance at discovering the bluff. This creates interesting situations which can vary greatly if you are playing against someone you know very well or against someone you've only just met.</p>\n<h1 id=\"things-ive-learned\"><a href=\"#things-ive-learned\" aria-label=\"things ive learned permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Things I've learned</h1>\n<p>This project was mainly an exercise in idea finding.

The learning curve was quite steep at first since all architectural levels rely on conventions or even entirely new languages, like the view model based on Fusion (formerly TypoScript). Getting to learn these concepts on such a project was not easy considering the importance of keeping everything abstract enough to work for a multitude of clients.</p>\n<p>Once the familiarity with Neos, Fusion, and Fluid kept growing, developing new functionality became more and more effortless. Towards the end of 2017 I was put in charge of the development, creating most new features and handling the development strategy by myself. This gave my a level of flexibility and insight into the planning side that was very much different to how other projects were handled.

The project was split into mutliple packages in order to achieve a proper separation of concerns. These packages then had dependencies among each other that were handled manually for the most part.

FX was created to be the standard UI library for Java, replacing the likes of Swing and AWT. At university we were introduced to the concepts of FX in some places, however, Swing was still the standard. This meant that we had some idea of how to develop apps using FX, but it was still fairly new to us.</p>\n<p>Much of the code, like the components and the fluid API, was realised in Java. This proved to be a rather comfortable development process, especially with the help of FX, offering things like two-way bindings and value observers.</p>\n<p>We used JUnit for testing, having used it many times throughout our time at university. The overwhelming popularity of JUnit as a testing framework speaks volumes and we had no issues whatsoever in our attempt at achieving a code coverage of more than 80%.</p>\n<p>Other than the Java code, only some CSS code was used for styling purposes.

A combination of Haskell concurrency in the backend and state management on the dashboard allowed us to handle most cases where concurrent access could lead to problems.

This was especially obvious while setting up the project. Getting to know Cabal as the dependency manager, finding new libraries on Hackage and then sorting out issues with Cabal took quite some time. Stack would have been the much better alternative for dependency management, however, getting a somewhat current version of Haskell to run on the Raspberry Pi was hard enough already, so setting one up that was also compatible with Stack was something we did not want to tackle.</p>\n<p>We decided to use Haskell only for the backend and the hardware communication. This was possible thanks to libraries like HPi, sqlite-simple, scotty, and websockets. Combining these tools was a very efficient way of creating a powerful application with few lines of code that were easy to document and understand.</p>\n<p>The dashboard was created using React and Redux, enhanced with ImmutableJS data structures. This was not the first React project I'd worked on, but certainly the first where I used Redux properly.
