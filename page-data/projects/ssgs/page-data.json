It was an interesting process, with people helping me out with some bugs and requesting interesting new features. SSGS' moderate success got me interested in using GitHub more seriously and to start contributing to other open-source projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technologies-ive-used\"><a href=\"#technologies-ive-used\" aria-label=\"technologies ive used permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies I've used</h1>\n<p>It's a relatively simple project. The biggest part of it is the SCSS code. Version 1 didn't rely on many features of SCSS and could've been implemented in basic CSS as well.</p>\n<p>However, version 2 took things a step further. I started using loops, conditionals, extends, etc. and while the codebase turned more and more complex, SSGS became more and more powerful. In fact, I'm using a slightly modified version of SSGS on this site.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"01 April 2011","path":"/projects/ssgs","title":"SSGS","end":null,"client":null,"link":"https://sacha.me/SSGS/","repo":"https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa/SSGS","team":1,"pattern":"dots","background":"rgb(207, 118, 89)","teaser":"Grid systems are a fundamental part of design.
